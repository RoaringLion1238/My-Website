        <p>You decided to get tools first. Wise choice. Once you have the tools, you head to the village which is next to a lava pool. You take some beds and then you use the lava pool to make a nether portal. The nether is the the underworld of minecraft. Once you are in the nether, you find a fortress and a blaze spawner. There, you kill blazes untill you have at least 7 blaze rods. You craft that into blaze powder. Then you go to a bastion and steal some gold. Once you do that, you barter for ender pearls. You combine those with the blaze powder and head to the overworld. One there, you use your eyes of ender to find the end portal. One you find it, you activate it and head to the dragon. You use a bow that you found to take out the crystals and wait for the dragon to perch. Once it does, you use the beds and kill it.</p>
