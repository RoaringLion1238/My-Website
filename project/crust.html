        <h1>The Earth: An Ogre (due to the fact that "Ogres have Layers.")</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>You have gone inside the crust. This is the first layer, and is only around 100km thick on the thickest parts. It is the least dense of all the layers, and is also mostly solid. It is made of rocks and minerals. While slowly drilling down, you have some time, so lets look at the vocab words:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Reflection:</b> Waves that bounce back</li>
          <li><b>Refraction:</b> Waves that change direction</li>
          <li><b>Seismic Wave:</b> Energy released in earthquakes and massive explosions</li>
          <li><b>Mantle:</b> Liquid and semi-solid layer of magma</li>
          <li><b>Inner Core:</b> Solid layer of metals pressurized within the Earth</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Now that you have seen the vocab, we can go even deeper.</h2>
