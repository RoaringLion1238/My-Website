        <h1>The Earth: An Ogre (due to the fact that "Ogres have Layers.")</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>You are now in the Outer Core, a fully liquid layer made up of Nickel and Iron. This layer is even hotter than the mantle,  and is 2200km thick, so almost as thick as the mantle. It is the second to most dense layer, and it is not a fun place to be in without protection from the heat. While waiting for you to go down, you decide to look at some info on Earth's sublayers.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Our Earth also contains sublayers. The two we will focus on are the <b>lithosphere and asthenosphere</b></li>
          <li><b>Lithosphere</b> is the scientific name for the Earth's crust. There are two types. Continental and oceanic <b>lithosphere.</b></li>
          <li><b>Asthenosphere</b> is the scientific name for the Earth's Upper mantle. It is where convection currents take place</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>You have now arrived at the final layer. Time to finish what you started..</h2>
