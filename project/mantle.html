        <hr>
        <h2>Now that you are in the mantle, you need to watch out. It is semi-solid, being made mostly out of magma, and is 2800 km thick. It is the second to least dense, after the crust, and it is very the thickest layer. While you go through this layer, you do some research on the all the layers.</h2>
        <h2>Here are some facts on the layers of the earth:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><label for="layers">Earth is broken down into 4 main layers</label><ul id="layers"><b><li>Inner core</li><li>Outer core</li><li>Mantle</li><li> The Crust</li></b></ul></li>
          <li>Each layer is separated due to its density. The <b>Inner Core</b> is the most dense so it's at the bottom, while the <b>crust</b> is the least dense so it's on top</li>
        </ul>
