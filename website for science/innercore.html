        <h1>The Earth: An Ogre (due to the fact that "Ogres have Layers.")</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>You have reached the final layer, the Inner Core. Here, you notice it is made out of solid Nickel and Iron, even though it should be hotter here than in the outer core. Well, the outer core creates enough pressure to squeeze the atoms of the inner core so closely together, that they form into a solid. This also makes it the densest, putting it at the very bottom of the layer sandwich, and while it is only 1280km thick, it still takes some time to go through it, so you study up on seismic waves.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Seismic Waves</b> are created when an Earthquake or massive explosion takes place. These waves are released in all directions at the same speed.</li>
          <li>The two types of <b>seismic waves</b> are P-waves and S-waves. These waves act differently</li>
          <li><b>P-waves</b> move faster, move in straight lines called "compression", and can move through both solids and liquids.</li>
          <li><b>S-waves</b> move slower, move in a zig-zag pattern, and can only move through solids.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Now that you have finished the journey, you can go back home..</h2>
